This statement\\nrelates to actions and activities during the financial year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019.\\nAs part of the shipping industry, \"K\" Line Group recognizes that it has a responsibility to take a robust\\napproach to slavery and human trafficking.\\n\"K\" Line Group is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate activities,\\nand to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.\\nOrganizational structure and activities\\nThe \"K\" Line Group is a global shipping entity headquartered in Tokyo, Japan but with a network of offices\\naround the globe including the United Kingdom. The UK Group comprises \"K\" Holding (Europe) Ltd, \"K\" Line\\n(Europe) Ltd, \"K\" Line Bulk Shipping (UK) Ltd, \"K\" Line LNG Shipping Ltd and Polar LNG Shipping (UK) Ltd.\\n\"K\" Line Group\\'s UK business units\\' activities include Car carrier, Dry Bulk and LNG shipping, management\\nTraining and relevant policies\\n\"K\" Line Group companies adhere to a Charter of Conduct which emphasizes due respect to Human rights\\nand compliance with applicable laws, ordinances and rules. \"K\" Line abides by all labour laws and regulations\\nand does not tolerate child labour or forced labour. Our Charter of Conduct is presented to new staff as part of\\nThe full Charter of Conduct can be viewed here:\\nttps:llww.kline.co.jplenlcsrigrouplcharterhtml\\nWhistleblowing policy\\nThe organization encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns\\nrelated to the direct activities, or the supply chains of the organization This includes any circumstances that\\nmay give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The organization\\'s whistleblowing\\nprocedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.\\nManaging some parts of our supply chain carries inherent risks of adverse socia or environmental impact due\\nto less direct oversight and control of their working conditions and recruiting practices These would include\\nships under construction or dismantling where employment conditions of subcontracted workers could present\\na risk, as does the use of third-party manning and crewing agencies for our shipping businesses. In both\\nsituations the use of on-site visits, audit type process and formalized assessments is employed. In addition,\\nthe type of ships directly managed (LNG) are relatively sophisticated, and as a sector, are less exposed to\\nunsatisfactory labour practices.\\n\"K\" Line Group has also developed Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines for Supply Chain which details\\nour requirements for suppliers, including adherence to abolition of forced and child labour.\\nThe Guidelines can be found here:\\nluosliwwwkinecoplencsiegoupsupoichaincsaicelnelnandliNcsr Guidelines for Supply Chain.p\\nAwareness-raising programme\\n\"K\" Line Group has raised awareness of modern slavery issues by putting up posters across the\\norganization\\'s premises.\\nThe posters explain to staff:\\nthe basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;\\nWhat external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline?\\nIt should also be noted that a transportation group such as \"K\" Line Group must already ensure that their\\nvessels are not used for illegal purposes including people trafficking.
