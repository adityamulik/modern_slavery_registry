       " 'final_statement': 'ASM Technologies Limited Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement We are committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. The Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) requires us to disclose information regarding our efforts to assist with the eradication of slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain and within our own business. Our Structure We deliver agile technology distribution across the IT channel concentrating on Tier 2 and 3 brands. ASM Technologies Limited has a 100% subsidiary, ASM Technologies GmbH, based in Germany. We have a combined workforce of 70 employees, principally based and operating out of the UK. Our Policies on slavery and human trafficking Slavery and human trafficking are illegal and a violation of human rights. There are many forms of modern slavery, which involve a person losing their freedom or being exploited by another for commercial gain. We have a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking. We expect this to be embedded within all our business dealings and expect vendors, customers and other business partners to adopt a similar high standard of approach. Due Diligence As part of our initiatives we have reviewed the anti-slavery statements, where applicable, of our major partners. We are reassured that their policies and procedures in the main, help to eradicate slavery and human trafficking. Compliance We have controls in place we feel are appropriate to ensure that our employees have the right to work and are thus protected by employment legislation. This includes checking right to work documents, passports and visas as appropriate. We do not knowingly employ those that would be considered child workers. Where work experience is offered to young or inexperienced workers, then they are subject to the rights and protections offered to all our workers. We expect our vendors to operate fully within the laws and regulations in country, including regarding slavery and human trafficking. This is taken account of when choosing and retaining such vendors. Responsibility ASM’s Finance Director, has overall responsibility for ensuring this statement complies with our legal and ethical obligations. He also has responsibility for updating the policy to reflect future changes in legislation. All employees are encouraged to raise concerns about any suspicions they have on slavery or human trafficking, in any part of our business or supply chain. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Act and constitutes our anti-slavery and human trafficking statement for the year ended 31° March 2018 Signed: CJ Swallow FCA- Finance Director ASM Technologies Limited 17\" May 2018',\n",

This statement relates to actions and activities during the financial year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. As part of the shipping industry, “K” Line Group recognizes that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human trafficking. \"K” Line Group is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking. Organizational structure and activities The “K” Line Group is a global shipping entity headquartered in Tokyo, Japan but with a network of offices around the globe including the United Kingdom. The UK Group comprises “K” Holding (Europe) Ltd, “K\" Line (Europe) Ltd, \"K” Line Bulk Shipping (UK) Ltd, \"K” Line LNG Shipping Ltd and Polar LNG Shipping (UK) Ltd. “K” Line Group’s UK business units’ activities include Car carrier, Dry Bulk and LNG shipping, management and operations. Training and relevant policies Charter of Conduct “K\" Line Group companies adhere to a Charter of Conduct which emphasizes due respect to Human rights and compliance with applicable laws, ordinances and rules. “K” Line abides by all labour laws and regulations and does not tolerate child labour or forced labour. Our Charter of Conduct is presented to new staff as part of their training. The full Charter of Conduct can be viewed here: https://www.kline.co.jp/en/csr/group/charter.htm| Whistleblowing policy The organization encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of the organization. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The organization\\'s whistieblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Due diligence Managing some parts of our supply chain carries inherent risks of adverse social or environmental impact due to less direct oversight and control of their working conditions and recruiting practices. These would include ships under construction or dismantling where employment conditions of subcontracted workers could present a risk, as does the use of third-party manning and crewing agencies for our shipping businesses. In both situations the use of on-site visits, audit type process and formalized assessments is employed. In addition, the type of ships directly managed (LNG) are relatively sophisticated, and as a sector, are less exposed to unsatisfactory labour practices. “K” Line Group has also developed Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines for Supply Chain which details our requirements for suppliers, including adherence to abolition of forced and child labour. The Guidelines can be found here: httos://www.kline.co.jp/en/csr/group/supplychaincsrquideline/main/O/link/CSR_ Guidelines for Supply Chain.p df Registered Office: 6th Fioor 200 Aldersgate Street London EC1A 4HD Company Registered in England Ne, 5005018 Awareness-raising programme “K” Line Group has raised awareness of modern slavery issues by putting up posters across the organization\\'s premises. The posters explain to staff: e the basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015; e What external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline? It should also be noted that a transportation group such as “K” Line Group must already ensure that their vessels are not used for illegal purposes including people trafficking. As part of this we engage with third party contractors and suppliers to ensure they have procedures in place to protect against illegal activity such a human trafficking.

Given the nature of our business, our supply chain mostly consists of the hiring of independent consultants and other service providers, and the procurement of other software-related goods and services. About our supply chain, we consider ourselves to be low risk. However, due diligence is undertaken by 1Spatial to ensure we only engages with reputable suppliers and avoids contracting with suppliers or subcontractors which are located within geographical areas where slavery and/or human trafficking are a risk. We undertake Supplier Assessments to establish risk profiles before engaging with them. These assessments are regularly reviewed as part of our Quality Management System (QMS). This includes the review of suppliers, sub-contractors and independent consultants who work with us as Associates. We do not support a supply chain where we have reasonable evidence of slavery or human trafficking.
